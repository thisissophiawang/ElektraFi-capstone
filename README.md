## ElektraFi: Gamified Financial Wellness Platform

This project is part of our capstone research at Northeastern University Vancouver, focused on increasing user retention in financial wellness platforms by introducing a gamified task page. Built on the principles of Self-Determination Theory (SDT), ElektraFi uses features like streaks, badges, and progress tracking to enhance user motivation and foster consistent financial habits such as saving, budgeting, and debt reduction.
